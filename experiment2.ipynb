Although breast cancer is much more common \\nin women, this form of cancer can also develop in men. In both women and men, the \\nmost common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the milk ducts (ductal cancer). \\nIn women, cancer can also develop in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer). \\nMost men have little or no lobular tissue, so lobular cancer in men is very rare. \\nIn its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no \\nnoticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a \\nlump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; \\nnipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling,'),\n",
